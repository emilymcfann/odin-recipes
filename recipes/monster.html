        <h3>Cookie description:</h3>
        <p>These cookies are great just from the oven, but even more 
            amazing you can freeze them after baking and when you thaw 
            them out they will be just as chewy and good as 
            they were when they were fresh.</p>
             <p>Recipe is easily 
            halved or doubled. Yummy!</p>
